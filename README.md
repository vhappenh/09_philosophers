# philosophers

The "Philosophers" project involves learning the basics of threading a process, focusing on creating threads and utilizing mutexes. 
Philosophers, as described in the project, engage in activities such as eating, thinking, and sleeping while seated at a round table with a bowl of spaghetti in the center. 
They follow specific rules during these activities: while eating, they cannot think or sleep; while thinking, they cannot eat or sleep; and while sleeping, they cannot eat or think. 
Each philosopher has a fork on each side of them to facilitate eating. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that all philosophers can eat and avoid starving.

The project follows common instructions, including writing the code in C and adhering to the Norm. 
It emphasizes proper memory management, requiring all heap allocated memory space to be correctly freed. 
A Makefile must be included to compile the source files with specified flags, and it should contain rules for cleaning and recompiling the project.
